          <h1>Sine Easing</h1>

          <p>
            Sine easing creates a gentle, natural-looking animation by following the curve of a sine wave. It's perfect for creating smooth, subtle, and organic transitions that feel effortless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like other eases, you can use <code>sine.in</code>, <code>sine.out</code>, and <code>sine.inOut</code> to control the acceleration and deceleration of the animation.

          <h3>The Art of Smooth Motion</h3>

          <p>
            The concept of easing is fundamental to animation. It's what gives motion its character and makes it feel natural and believable. Without easing, animations would feel robotic and lifeless, moving at a constant speed from start to finish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sine easing, which you're exploring in this lesson, is one of the most versatile and widely used easing functions. Its gentle acceleration and deceleration make it perfect for a wide range of applications, from subtle UI transitions to complex character animations. It provides a soft, smooth, and organic quality to the motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 12 basic principles of animation, as introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book "The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation," are a set of guidelines that are still highly relevant today. Principles like "Slow In and Slow Out" (which is essentially what easing is), "Anticipation," and "Follow Through and Overlapping Action" all contribute to creating animations that are more engaging and realistic.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you progress through your GSAP journey, you'll discover a rich library of easing functions, each with its own unique personality. From the dramatic flair of "Expo" to the playful bounce of "Elastic," mastering these tools will allow you to craft animations that not only look good but also effectively communicate the desired mood and message.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experimentation is key. Play with different easing functions and their parameters. Observe how they affect the timing and feel of your animations. The more you experiment, the more intuitive your understanding of motion will become.

            This long scrollable area is here to demonstrate how sine easing can be used to create a smooth "scroll-to-top" animation. Click the arrow button at the bottom to see it in action. Notice the gentle start and end of the scroll, a classic use case for sine easing.
